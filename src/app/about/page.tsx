        description: "Hi, I&apos;m Aayush K Agarwal, a passionate full-stack developer currently based in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India. I have persued a Bachelor&apos;s in Electronics, and Communications Engineering from ABES Engineering College. My journey as a self-taught developer has fueled my passion for building software that solves real-world problems, which is why much of what I create is open source. My expertise spans front-end and back-end technologies, with a particular focus on frameworks like React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. In my professional experience, I&apos;ve worked as a Software Engineer at Sopra Steria, contributing to significant projects in the healthcare and agricultural sectors, where I specialized in state management and API integration. Whether collaborating with UX/UI designers or working on personal projects like the Filmpier App and Quote Rider, my goal is always to deliver responsive, user-friendly applications that make a difference.",
