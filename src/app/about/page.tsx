        description: "Hi, I&apos;m Aayush K Agarwal, a passionate full-stack developer currently based in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India. I have persued a Bachelor&apos;s in Electronics, and Communications Engineering from ABES Engineering College. My journey as a self-taught developer has fueled my passion for building software that solves real-world problems, which is why much of what I create is open source. My expertise spans front-end and back-end technologies, with a particular focus on frameworks like React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. In my professional experience, I&apos;ve worked as a Software Engineer at Sopra Steria, contributing to significant projects in the healthcare and agricultural sectors, where I specialized in state management and API integration. Whether collaborating with UX/UI designers or working on personal projects like the Filmpier App and Quote Rider, my goal is always to deliver responsive, user-friendly applications that make a difference.",

                    <span>I don’t wait for opportunities to knock. I build the door, design the handle, and make sure the experience of opening it feels unforgettable.</span>

                    <span>I’ve spent the last few years engineering systems, marketing ideas, and now shaping digital interfaces that people actually click on — and keep coming back to. From shipping microsites across India, Dubai, and Singapore to reinventing merchandising workflows at Ferns N Petals, I’ve seen how small design decisions can bend conversion graphs. That’s where my obsession with product began — at the intersection of user behavior, business intent, and elegant execution.</span>

                    <span>I’m not chasing buzzwords. I’m chasing clarity — the kind that comes from listening to users, questioning assumptions, and cutting through noise to build what matters.</span>

                    <span>Today, I’m sharpening that edge through real-world case studies, growth experiments, and Airtribe’s Product Management program — pushing beyond “good UI” into the thinking behind great products.</span>

                    <span>Titles don’t impress me. Outcomes do.</span>

                    <span>If you’re building something bold and need someone who’ll question the obvious, connect the dots, and ship with intent — let’s talk.</span>
